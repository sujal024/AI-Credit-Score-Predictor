***AI Credit Score Predictor***
 **Description**

AI Credit Score Predictor is a machine learning project that predicts an individual's credit score based on their financial, behavioral, and demographic data.
It demonstrates the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training, evaluation, and deployment through a simple prediction app interface.

This project is ideal for understanding how credit risk models work and how ML can assist in automating financial decisions.

 **Features**

  Data Preprocessing & Cleaning – Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visual insights into customer behavior and credit score distribution.
  Model Training & Evaluation – Building classification models using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost).
  Model Persistence – Saving trained models for later predictions.
  Interactive App – Simple UI for entering user data and viewing predicted credit scores in real time.
  Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Deployment (optional): Streamlit / Flask

**Model Insights**

The model analyzes various features such as:
Annual income
Loan history
Number of credit accounts
Credit utilization rate

Payment history
to estimate a user’s likelihood of maintaining a good or poor credit score.
